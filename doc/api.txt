API Overview

--Account's & Login--
## User Registration ##
# User's have to 'claim' an email and verify they own that address. We can pass
# a ClaimToken in the email body and when they click a link it sends them back
# to this system with that token for account setup. 
# We could also have a "merge" and "unmerge" to claim multiple emails but that
# is a little out of the project scope
